# Examples

This repository hosts examples, how-tos and tutorials for FEDn and STACKn. 

Please read the README in each respective example for more information.

The examples in this repository are all maintained by Scaleout and/or core developers in the community, and can be expected to be regularly updated with each new release of the software. 

Below we maintain a list of public examples and projects by external users and partners. If you have an example that you want to include, talk to a core developer in [Discord](https://discord.gg/CCRgjpMsVA) and/or send a PR updating this README. To be included, please make sure to have a clear contact person listed for the example.
